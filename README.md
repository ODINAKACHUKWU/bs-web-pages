# BS-web-pages

BS-web-pages is composed of simple and advanced web pages built with Bootstrap and Material designs for bootstrap (Version: MDB Free 4.8.11).

[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the newest version of Bootstrap, which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.

[Material designs for bootstrap (MDB)](https://mdbootstrap.com) is a popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites and apps.

The tutorials I followed to build the pages can be found here:
